# PdtClock — the β-clock's tick word is aperiodic but not random (Sturmian structure)

The PDT β-clock emits, tick after tick, a DURATION word: at step `n` the tick
lasts `⌊(n+1)β⌋ − ⌊nβ⌋` units, where `β` is the (irrational) clock slope
`β = ln|σ_Q| / (½ ln ρ) ≈ 0.4367860016 ∈ (0,1)`. This module certifies, in the
kernel, the four properties that make that word **deterministic, structured and
non-repeating** — the mechanical/Sturmian properties of a Beatty (mechanical)
word of a general slope `β`:

* **T1 — TWO-VALUED** (`m_mem`): for `0 < β < 1`, every duration is `0` or `1`.
  The clock speaks a binary alphabet; there is no third symbol.
* **T2 — DENSITY = β** (`sum_m_eq`, `sum_m_bounds`, `density_tendsto`): the
  running 1-count telescopes exactly to `⌊Nβ⌋`, and the frequency of `1`'s
  converges to `β`. The long-run tick rate is the slope itself.
* **T3 — APERIODIC** (`aperiodic`): for irrational `β` the word has NO period —
  it never repeats. (Deterministic yet non-periodic: the hallmark of the clock.)
* **T4 — BALANCED** (`balanced`): any two windows of the SAME length have
  1-counts differing by at most `1`. This is the precise "not random / maximally
  even" Sturmian balance property — the strongest single statement here.

The object is the **mechanical (Beatty) word** `m β : ℕ → ℤ`,
`m β n = ⌊(n+1)·β⌋ − ⌊n·β⌋`, taken for an abstract slope. Every proof reduces to
elementary `Int.floor` facts (`Int.floor_le`, `Int.lt_floor_add_one`,
`Int.le_floor`, `Int.floor_lt`); no symbolic-dynamics API is used. The one
non-elementary input is quarantined as a hypothesis, see Scope.

## Scope (what is proved here, and what is deliberately NOT)

* This module certifies the WORD'S structure for a general real slope `β`,
  taken abstractly. The identification of the PDT tick map `(δ, ℓ)` dynamics
  with exactly this word `m β` is the dynamical / H4 piece and is **out of
  scope** here.
* That the PDT value `β = ln|σ_Q|/(½ ln ρ)` satisfies `0 < β < 1` is a separate
  numeric lemma (bounds on the two logs) and is **not** proved here; `0 < β`,
  `β < 1` enter T1/T2 as hypotheses.
* That the PDT `β` is **irrational** rests on Baker's theorem (a ratio of logs of
  multiplicatively-independent algebraics is transcendental). Baker's theorem is
  **not in Mathlib**, so `Irrational β` is a **hypothesis** in T3/T4-adjacent
  statements, never a kernel step. It is honestly carried, never discharged.

All statements quantify over the slope `β`, so they apply to the PDT slope the
instant the three scope facts above are supplied from outside.

/-! ## T3 — APERIODIC (the word never repeats, for irrational slope) -/

/-- **T3 — APERIODIC.** For an irrational slope `β`, the tick word has NO
period: there is no `p > 0` with `m β (n+p) = m β n` for all `n`.

Proof: a period `p` forces the cumulative floor to be additive over the period,
`cumFloor β (n+p) = cumFloor β n + cumFloor β p` (induction on `n` via the
forward-difference recurrence), hence `cumFloor β (M·p) = M·cumFloor β p` for
all `M`. Comparing with the floor bracket `Mpβ < cumFloor β (M·p) + 1` gives
`M · Int.fract(pβ) < 1` for ALL `M`; but `Int.fract(pβ) > 0` (as `pβ` is
irrational), so this fails for large `M` (Archimedean). -/
