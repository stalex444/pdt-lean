# PdtCommitment — contraction, separation and windowed permanence on ℚ(ρ)

`K = ℚ(ρ)`, `ρ` the real root of `f = x³ − x − 1`, has signature (1,1): one real
embedding `σ₁ : ρ ↦ r` and one conjugate pair `σ₂, σ̄₂ : ρ ↦ z, z̄` with `z`
non-real. Everything below is a theorem about those embeddings and about the
image `σ₂(ℤ[ρ]) ⊆ ℂ` of the order `ℤ[ρ]`. Three groups of results:

* **(1) The exact contraction rate** (`tick_contraction`): `r·‖z‖² = 1`, so
  multiplication by `z` contracts the complex place by exactly `r^(−1/2)`
  (`norm_z_eq_rpow`: `‖z‖ = r^(−1/2)`; `norm_z_lt_one`: `‖z‖ < 1`). This is an
  identity of the field — the norm relation `N(ρ) = 1` read at the two
  archimedean places — and not a numerical estimate.
* **(2) The integrality floor** (`meyer_separation`, `meyer_separation_rpow`):
  for every nonzero `x ∈ ℤ[ρ]` with coordinates `(a,b,c)`, writing
  `x₁ = a + b·r + c·r²` and `x₂ = a + b·z + c·z²`, the product `x₁·‖x₂‖²` is a
  nonzero rational integer (`normForm_factor`), hence `1 ≤ |x₁|·‖x₂‖²`, hence
  `‖x₂‖ ≥ |x₁|^(−1/2)`.
* **(3) Windowed permanence**:
  (a) `lattice_tick_invariant`: multiplication by `z` maps `σ₂(ℤ[ρ])` onto
      itself (`ρ` is a unit, `ρ⁻¹ = ρ² − 1 ∈ ℤ[ρ]`);
  (b) `windowed_separation`: two distinct points of `σ₂(ℤ[ρ])` whose real
      embeddings differ by at most `H` are at distance `≥ H^(−1/2)` — uniform
      discreteness on any window of bounded real coordinate;
  (c) `certification_soundness`: if `w` lies within `(1/2)·H^(−1/2)` of the
      point `σ₂(ℓ)`, then for every `n` the point `zⁿ·w` is strictly closer to
      `zⁿ·σ₂(ℓ) = σ₂(ρⁿℓ)` than to every OTHER point `σ₂(ℓ')` whose real
      embedding lies within `H` of that of `ρⁿℓ`: the nearest-point reading
      inside the window never changes.

## Scope

These are statements about the arithmetic of `ℚ(ρ)` and the metric geometry of
`ℂ`. Reading multiplication by `z` as one step of a dynamics, `σ₂(ℤ[ρ])` as a
record lattice, and (3c) as the permanence of a recorded outcome is an
**identification, not evaluated here**. The kernel certifies the mathematics; the
physical reading is stated outside it.

## Faithfulness notes (reformulations, none weakening)

* `ℤ[ρ]` elements are represented by their coordinate triples
  `(a, b, c) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ` in the power basis `(1, ρ, ρ²)`; the embeddings are
  `embed r` (real) and `embed z` (complex), `embed t (a,b,c) = a + b·t + c·t²`.
  "`x ≠ 0` in `ℤ[ρ]`" is `(a,b,c) ≠ 0`, and `embed_ne_zero` proves the two
  representations agree (nonzero triples embed to nonzero numbers; this uses
  irreducibility of `x³ − x − 1` over ℚ, imported from `PdtIrreducible`).
* The roots `r` and `z` are characterized by their defining equations
  `r³ = r + 1` (`r : ℝ`) and `z³ = z + 1, z.im ≠ 0` (`z : ℂ`) — every theorem
  quantifies over ALL such `r, z`, which is stronger than fixing particular
  roots. (The real cubic has exactly one real root and one conjugate pair, so
  these hypotheses pin the objects up to conjugation, under which every
  statement below is invariant.)
* (3c) is stated with the explicit window hypothesis
  `|σ₁(ℓ') − σ₁(ρⁿℓ)| ≤ H`, and that hypothesis is essential: the UNWINDOWED
  image `σ₂(ℤ[ρ])` is dense in `ℂ` (standard, not formalized here), so only the
  windowed/bounded-horizon statement is true, and that is what is proved. No
  unwindowed permanence is claimed.
* Multiplication by `ρⁿ` acts on coordinates by `tick^[n]` where
  `tick (a,b,c) = (c, a+c, b)` (multiplication by `ρ` in the power basis);
  `embed_tick_iter` proves `σ(ρⁿ·x) = σ(ρ)ⁿ·σ(x)` for both embeddings, so the
  image of `ρⁿℓ` may be written either as `zⁿ·embed z ℓ` or as the lattice point
  `embed z (tick^[n] ℓ)` — they are proved equal.

lattice point `ℓ' ≠ ρⁿℓ` whose real embedding lies within `H` of that of
`ρⁿℓ`, the point `zⁿ·w` is strictly closer to `zⁿ·σ₂(ℓ)` than to `σ₂(ℓ')`:
the nearest-point reading within the window never changes. Proof = exact
equivariance + monotone contraction (`‖z‖ < 1`) + triangle inequality against
(3b). The window hypothesis is essential and explicit: the unwindowed image of
`ℤ[ρ]` at the complex place is dense. -/
