# The (3,1) signature of the trace form of K = ℚ[x]/(x⁴ − x − 1)

The trace form (Gram matrix in the power basis {1, x, x², x³}) is the
integer matrix `M` with `M_{ij} = p_{i+j}`, the power sums of the roots of
`x⁴ − x − 1`. Newton's identities (e₁=0, e₂=0, e₃=1, e₄=−1) give
`p₀=4, p₁=0, p₂=0, p₃=3, p₄=4, p₅=0, p₆=3`, hence

  `M = !![4,0,0,3; 0,0,3,4; 0,3,4,0; 3,4,0,3]`.

We prove, all kernel-checked:

* `det_M`        : `det M = -283`  (negative ⇒ an odd number of negative
                   eigenvalues, hence at least one),
* `congruence`   : an explicit invertible rational `P` (with `det P = -1`)
                   carries `M` to a diagonal form `Pᵀ M P = D`,
                   `D = diag(4, 4, -9/4, 283/36)`,
* the diagonal of `D` has exactly THREE positive entries and ONE negative
  entry (`D00_pos`, `D11_pos`, `D33_pos`, `D22_neg`).

By Sylvester's law of inertia the signature of `M` equals the signs of the
diagonal of any such `D`, i.e. **(3, 1)**. The bundled statement is
`signature_3_1`.

The matrix `P` was produced by symmetric Gaussian elimination with a
permutation to dodge the zero leading 2×2 minor (`M₁₁ = M₂₂ over the
{x,x²} block is singular`).

NOTE ON TACTICS: the two determinant evaluations use `decide +kernel`
(kernel-trusted reduction of a `Decidable` equality of explicit rationals;
this is NOT `native_decide` and adds no compiler trust). The axiom set of
every theorem below is exactly `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.

/-- **The (3,1) signature theorem (concrete Sylvester form).**

There is an invertible rational congruence `P` carrying the trace form `M`
to the diagonal form `D` whose diagonal has exactly three positive entries
and one negative entry. By Sylvester's law of inertia the signature of the
real quadratic form `M` is therefore `(3, 1)`. Together with `det_M = -283`
(`< 0`, forcing an odd number of negative signs) this pins the signature
uniquely. -/
